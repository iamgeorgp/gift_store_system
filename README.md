## Gift store analysis

The dataset includes all transactions conducted for a UK-registered company specializing in off-store sales of unique gift products for all occasions. Transactions period: from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011

As part of an analysis of a gift store accounting system, I was provided with dataset containing the order history of customers from around the world. The main objective of this project was to conduct an initial analysis of the data. While processing and researching the information, it was discovered that there has been a recent increase in the number of canceled orders.

An in-depth analysis allowed me to identify a discrepancy between canceled orders and fulfilled orders, which could lead to financial losses for the company. Therefore, it was proposed to reform the order accounting system, including the introduction of separate accounting for cancelations and returns. Such changes would help optimize business processes.

In addition, as part of this project, I conducted analytics by evaluating the relationship between customer country and key products, commodities, and profit and loss. These results served as a basis for adjusting the store strategy, including logistics and delivery. All data was visualized for easy and clear presentation.
